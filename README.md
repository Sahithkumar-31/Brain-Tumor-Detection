# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Introduction:

In the realm of medical diagnostics, the utilization of deep learning models has proven to be a transformative approach. One significant application is the detection of brain tumors through the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. This project presents an advanced deep learning model designed to accurately identify and classify brain tumors from MRI images.

Data Source:

The MRI scans used for training and testing the model were sourced from a curated dataset, available on Google Drive. The dataset comprises a diverse set of brain images, including both tumor and non-tumor cases. The use of real-world data ensures the robustness and generalization of the model.
